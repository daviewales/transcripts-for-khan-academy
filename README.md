## Contributing

- This project uses [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) for hosting.
- We take advantage of GitHub Pages' Markdown support, and a slight hack to enable KaTeX instead of MathJax.
- The directory structure is designed to mirror the structure of Khan Academy subjects.
- Each Khan Academy video is given a dedicated Markdown page.
- Each page should have the same title as the video it is summarising.
- The video should be embedded at the top of the page using the official Khan Academy embed guidlines.

Please read Khan Academy's [official guidelines](https://khanacademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202262954-Can-I-use-Khan-Academy-s-videos-name-materials-links-) for third party remixing.
